      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        I bring over seven years of applied qualitative research experience across academic, nonprofit, and product-facing environments.
        My PhD in Sociology (with a focus on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis) trained me to examine how people actually coordinate
        work, communication, and technology in everyday settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research often focuses on high-complexity environments where digital tools, organizational constraints, and human interaction overlap.
        I am especially interested in workflows, collaboration, implementation gaps, and the practical work people do to make systems function.
      </p>

      <p>
        Methodologically, I combine ethnography, interviews, video analysis, and qualitative synthesis. I do not just document what users say.
        I analyze how tasks unfold in practice, where friction happens, and what that means for product design, service design, or organizational strategy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have led multi-site qualitative studies, conducted hundreds of hours of field observation, built research narratives for mixed audiences,
        and translated dense findings into clear design and policy recommendations. I am currently focused on UX Research roles where I can apply
        ethnographic depth to product and service challenges.
