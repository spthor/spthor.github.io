          <h3>Digital Learning Platform User Experience Study</h3>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>
              A large-scale education initiative introduced digital learning platforms into public schools, but adoption and classroom integration
              were inconsistent. Stakeholders needed to understand how implementation differed across real classroom settings and why intended use
              often broke down in practice.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>My Role & Methods</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Led end-to-end qualitative research design and execution across multiple field sites</li>
              <li>Conducted 30+ stakeholder interviews with teachers, administrators, and intermediary organizations</li>
              <li>Collected and analyzed 200+ hours of classroom video and observational data</li>
              <li>Mapped teacher workflows and classroom coordination patterns around shared devices and projected screens</li>
              <li>Used NVivo/MAXQDA for systematic coding and synthesis</li>
              <li>Translated findings into design and implementation recommendations for program stakeholders</li>

            <h4>Impact</h4>
            <p>
              The research showed that “adoption” was not just a training issue. Teachers were actively adapting the platform to classroom realities,
              often repurposing features to fit time, infrastructure, and coordination constraints. These insights reframed the problem from user compliance
              to workflow fit, shaping more grounded design and support priorities.

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>
              During COVID-19, communities moved important social and ritual events to video platforms. The team needed to understand how people
              adapted embodied, in-person practices to mediated environments, and what this revealed about interaction design, participation, and social presence.

            <h4>My Role & Methods</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Led qualitative research strategy for a multi-method study of virtual interaction</li>
              <li>Conducted interviews and focus groups with participants and organizers</li>
              <li>Analyzed recorded virtual events to identify recurring interaction patterns and coordination practices</li>
              <li>Built structured comparisons across event types and user roles</li>

            <p>
              The study generated practical insight into how people preserve meaning and social coordination in digital environments.
              Findings helped frame better questions for platform design, especially around visibility, turn-taking, and ambient awareness.

            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>
              A community planning initiative aimed to increase public participation in local redevelopment, but faced uneven engagement and unclear
              communication between stakeholders. The project needed evidence on where participation broke down and how the process could be redesigned.
