          <h3>Digital Learning Platform Implementation Study</h3>
          <p class="project-meta">UX Research | Multi-site Classroom Fieldwork</p>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
              A large education initiative rolled out digital classroom tools across public schools, but usage was uneven and
              classroom integration was inconsistent. Stakeholders needed to understand the gap between platform expectations
              and real classroom use.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Methods</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>30+ stakeholder interviews (teachers, administrators, NGO intermediaries)</li>
              <li>200+ hours of classroom observation and video-based interaction analysis</li>
              <li>Workflow mapping of classroom teaching routines with shared devices</li>
              <li>Qualitative coding and synthesis in NVivo/MAXQDA</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>
              The main issue was not simply “low adoption.” Teachers were actively adapting the platform to local constraints
              such as shared screens, timing, infrastructure failures, and mixed learning levels. The product and implementation
              model did not match the workflow reality.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>
              Findings helped reframe the problem from compliance to workflow fit, supporting more grounded implementation and
              training recommendations. The work also produced reusable research artifacts for communicating classroom friction points
              to non-research stakeholders.

          <h3>Virtual Rituals and Remote Interaction Research</h3>
          <p class="project-meta">NSF-Funded Research | Platform-Mediated Behavior</p>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
              During COVID-19, communities moved social and ritual events to video platforms. The research goal was to understand
              how users preserved participation, meaning, and coordination when in-person interaction shifted to digital tools.
            </p>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Methods</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Interviews and focus groups with participants and organizers</li>
              <li>Analysis of recorded virtual events to identify recurring coordination patterns</li>
              <li>Cross-case comparison of interaction practices across event types</li>
              <li>Research synthesis for mixed audiences (academic and public-facing)</li>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>
              Users were not just “using Zoom.” They developed new interaction norms to recreate social presence, visibility,
              and timing. Small platform affordances shaped participation more than expected, especially around turn-taking and
              shared attention.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>
              The work generated practical insight into mediated interaction and informed recommendations for designing and
              evaluating remote experiences that depend on social coordination, not just functional access.

          <h3>Civic Engagement Participation Process Study</h3>
          <p class="project-meta">Community Systems Research | Service & Process Insight</p>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
              A community development initiative wanted broader public participation in local planning, but engagement remained
              uneven. Leaders needed evidence on where the process was excluding or discouraging participants.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Methods</h4>
            <ul>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>
              Participation barriers were not only informational. They were built into the structure of meetings, stakeholder roles,
              and communication expectations. The process itself created friction for many residents.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>
              Findings informed changes to outreach and meeting design, and helped stakeholders see participation as a service design
              problem rather than a simple communication problem.
